# Colorado Real Estate Analysis

What a fun challenge! It makes me appreciate pandas.

I finished #1-5, although was running out of time for #4-5 and left comments about what I would have done differently with more time.

Please look at the `analysis_notebook.ipynb` or `analysis_notebook.html`.

I used the `scratchpad.py` in iPython using the cell execution and "Scientific" 
method to debug as I wrote things.

Please note, I did not commit the data in the /data file.
